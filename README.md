# 🧠 Data Analysis Portfolio – Gustavo Coloma

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Portfolio**, where I showcase hands-on projects demonstrating my skills in **SQL**, **data cleaning**, **data visualization**, and **business insights**.  
This portfolio includes two main projects highlighting my analytical approach using **real-world datasets**.

## 📊 Projects Overview

### 1. COVID-19 Data Analysis (2020–2022)
**Tools Used:** SQL, Tableau  
**Focus Areas:** Global infection trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.

#### 🧩 Description
This project explores the global impact of COVID-19 from **2020 to 2022**.  
Using a dataset of reported cases and deaths by country, I performed **data cleaning**, **aggregations**, and **joins** in SQL to uncover trends such as:
- Global and regional infection rates  
- Death rates per population 
- Year-over-year changes in reported data  

The results were visualized in an **interactive Tableau dashboard** for a clearer understanding of the pandemic’s progression.

### 2. Nashville Housing Market Data Cleaning
**Tools Used:** SQL  
**Focus Areas:** Data transformation, standardization, and preparation for analysis.

#### 🧩 Description
This project focuses on cleaning and structuring **real estate transaction data** from the Nashville housing market.  
The goal was to make the dataset **analysis-ready** by performing tasks such as:
- Removing duplicates  
- Handling missing property data  
- Splitting and reformatting address fields  
- Standardizing date and price formats  

This project showcases my ability to write **efficient SQL queries** to transform messy raw data into a reliable dataset for analysis or visualization.
